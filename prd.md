Repository: https://github.com/kokists/techmind-website
Live Website: https://techmindinfosys.com/
Design Reference: https://aiqusearch.com/

## 1. Project Overview
TechMind Infosys is undergoing a full website redesign to elevate its brand identity, visual impact, and user experience. The goal is to deliver a modern, fast, responsive, and scalable website, inspired by best-in-class design patterns. The homepage already features advanced UI elements, but several areas require polish and full-page implementation.

## 2. Objectives
Improve the homepage design quality and resolve asset issues (e.g. one logo with visible white artifacts).

Fully build and design all internal pages to align visually with the homepage and reference site.

Implement a mobile-first responsive layout across the entire site.

Create a scalable, modular, and well-structured codebase using React + Tailwind CSS + Vite.

Ensure high performance, accessibility, and security across all pages.

Maintain design consistency, including unified hero sections for each page based on the homepage pattern.

## 3. Scope
### In Scope
Homepage refinement (asset replacement, layout, animation polish)

Design and development of the following pages:

- About
- Services
- Solutions / Capabilities
- Industries
- Careers
- Contact

Responsive design across all devices

Smooth navigation bar transitions

Scroll-triggered animations and transitions

Optimized logo display (fix and replace broken logo)

### Out of Scope
CMS, backend admin, or authentication systems

CRM integrations or eCommerce

Blog or dynamic article system (unless requested later)

## 4. Design Requirements
### Visual Language
Match modern and elegant look of https://aiqusearch.com

Use deep color palettes with gradients, blur effects, and parallax image layers

Apply unified spacing and section structure throughout the site

### Hero Section
Each internal page will include a hero section using the same design system and pattern as the homepage (animated background, title/subtitle hierarchy, parallax and blur effects)

Toggle mode buttons excluded from inner pages

### Typography
Use modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, DM Sans, or Poppins)

Implement responsive typography using Tailwind utilities

### Branding
Replace any broken or low-resolution logos (such as the one with white spots)

Ensure all logos are high-contrast, white, and evenly spaced

### Responsive Design
Mobile-first implementation required

Layouts must be responsive and fluid across breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, and 2xl

Navigation, hero sections, and call-to-action blocks should reflow and remain functional across all screen sizes

## 5. Functional Requirements
### Homepage
Refined dynamic hero section with typing animation and gradient overlays

Smooth scroll-based transitions and fade-in animations

Clean, responsive navigation bar that transitions from transparent to solid on scroll

Working and visually polished logos

Animated CTA button and subtitle

### Navigation Bar
Transparent when page loads, turns white on scroll

Responsive mobile dropdown version

Text color adapts based on navbar background

### Internal Pages
Consistent hero section design with blur overlays and background images

Full page content structured into well-defined sections

Final CTA section included on each page

All content structured using semantic HTML5 and responsive containers

## 6. Development Requirements
### Tech Stack
React + Vite for performance and scalability

Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

Framer Motion for animations

React Router for page navigation

### Code Structure
Use atomic or modular component structure

Pages: /src/pages

Shared components: /src/components

Assets: /src/assets/images

### Coding Practices
DRY and KISS principles

Use of reusable components

Descriptive variable and component naming

Remove unused styles and scripts

Separate layout components from content logic

## 7. Performance Optimization
Optimize all images (WebP or compressed JPG)

Enable lazy loading for non-critical content

Purge unused Tailwind CSS classes

Bundle optimization and code-splitting via Vite

## 8. Security & Stability Practices
Sanitize inputs and avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML

Use only https sources for all assets

Lock dependencies to specific versions

Remove dev-only logging before deployment

Validate form inputs (if added)

## 9. Accessibility Standards (a11y)
Use semantic tags (<section>, <nav>, <main>, etc.)

Alt attributes on all images

High contrast color usage

Keyboard-accessible interactive elements

Clearly visible focus states

## 10. Testing Requirements
Test layout and functionality across:

Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge

Devices: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile

Run Lighthouse Audit (Performance, Accessibility, SEO) and target 90+ score in all categories

Validate all links and navigation routes

## 11. Timeline & Milestones
| Phase | Task | Est. Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Replace broken logo in homepage | 0.5 day |
| 2 | Finalize homepage styling and animation | 1â€“2 days |
| 3 | Design and build About page | 1 day |
| 4 | Design and build Services page | 1 day |
| 5 | Design and build Solutions page | 1.5 days |
| 6 | Design and build Industries page | 1 day |
| 7 | Design and build Careers page | 1.5 days |
| 8 | Design and build Contact page | 1 day |
| 9 | Final polish, testing, accessibility audit | 1 day |

## 12. Deliverables
Fully deployed, mobile-responsive website at https://techmindinfosys.com

Updated GitHub repository with commits for each milestone

Optimized production build

Documentation for future developers (structure, components, editing guide)

## 13. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Design inconsistencies | Use shared design system and layout templates |
| Image/asset errors | Preprocess all assets and validate paths |
| Deployment issues | Use staging builds before pushing live |
| Performance regressions | Audit performance regularly during builds |

## 14. Acceptance Criteria
Hero sections across all pages match homepage design system (excluding toggle)

No visual defects or broken assets

Responsive design validated on all major screen sizes

High performance and accessibility scores

Page transitions, animations, and navigation work seamlessly

All page sections are structured, styled, and responsive
