# TechMind Website - Deployment Guide

This document outlines the steps to deploy the TechMind website to production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:

- Node.js 16+ and npm installed
- Access to the hosting platform credentials
- Completed all testing and QA steps

## 1. Production Build

Create an optimized production build by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing all the static files needed for deployment.

## 2. Environment Setup

Create or edit `.env.production` for production-specific environment variables:

```
VITE_APP_API_URL=https://api.techmind.com
VITE_APP_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-123456789-1
```

## 3. Static Hosting Options

### Option A: Netlify

1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in the project root:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

2. Deploy via Netlify CLI:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repository in the Netlify dashboard for CI/CD.

### Option B: Vercel

1. Create a `vercel.json` file in the project root:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

2. Deploy via Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repository in the Vercel dashboard for CI/CD.

### Option C: AWS S3 + CloudFront

1. Create an S3 bucket for website hosting
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to the bucket
3. Set up CloudFront for CDN and SSL
4. Configure bucket policy for public access

## 4. DNS Configuration

1. Point your domain to the hosting provider's name servers or IP
2. Configure SSL certificates
3. Set up www subdomain redirection if needed

## 5. Post-Deployment Verification

- Check for any console errors
- Verify all pages load correctly
- Test all interactive features
- Confirm responsive layout works on all targeted devices
- Run Lighthouse audits to ensure performance

## 6. Monitoring

- Set up uptime monitoring
- Configure error tracking
- Implement analytics to track user behavior

## CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)

For automated deployments, consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline using:

- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins

Example GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: netlify/actions/cli@master
        with:
          args: deploy --dir=dist --prod
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

## Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the last stable deployment
2. Revert to that version in your hosting platform
3. Investigate issues in a staging environment

## Security Considerations

- Ensure all API keys and secrets are properly secured
- Implement Content Security Policy headers
- Configure proper CORS settings if needed
- Use HTTPS only

## Performance Optimization

- Utilize the CDN provided by your hosting platform
- Enable gzip/Brotli compression
- Set appropriate cache headers
- Configure service workers for offline support

## Maintenance

Regularly check:

- Dependencies for security updates
- Performance metrics
- User feedback
- Error logs
