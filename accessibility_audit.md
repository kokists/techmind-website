# TechMind Website - Accessibility Audit

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the TechMind website and provides recommendations for further improvements.

## Current Accessibility Features

### Semantic HTML
- Used proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) across all pages
- Utilized semantic elements like `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Added proper `<button>` and `<a>` elements for interactive components

### ARIA Attributes
- Added `aria-expanded` to dropdown menus in the navigation
- Used `aria-required` and `aria-invalid` in form fields
- Implemented `aria-live` for form validation messages

### Keyboard Navigation
- Made all interactive elements focusable
- Ensured logical tab order through the UI
- Added visible focus states to all interactive elements

### Color and Contrast
- Used high contrast text/background combinations
- Added visual cues beyond just color (icons, text descriptions)

### Responsive Design
- Implemented responsive layouts that work on various screen sizes
- Used appropriate text sizes that scale across devices
- Ensured touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels on mobile

### Form Accessibility
- Added proper form labels that are associated with inputs
- Included clear error messages
- Grouped related form fields

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### 1. Skip to Content Link
Implement a "Skip to content" link that appears when tabbing begins, allowing keyboard users to bypass navigation.

```jsx
<a className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 focus:px-4 focus:py-2 focus:bg-blue-600 focus:text-white focus:rounded" href="#main-content">
  Skip to content
</a>
```

### 2. Enhanced Screen Reader Support
- Add more descriptive `aria-label` attributes to buttons and links that don't have clear text labels
- Include `role` attributes for custom components
- Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes

### 3. Improved Focus Management
- Add focus trapping for modals and dropdowns
- Restore focus to triggering elements when closing overlays
- Use `tabindex="-1"` for elements that should not receive keyboard focus

### 4. Additional Techniques
- Add reduced motion media query support
- Implement proper heading levels and landmarks
- Ensure all images have proper alt text
- Add appropriate text spacing for readability

## Testing Methodology

To thoroughly test accessibility, use the following approach:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Run Lighthouse accessibility audits
   - Use axe DevTools for automated checking

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test with keyboard only (no mouse)
   - Test with a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
   - Test with browser zoom set to 200%
   - Test with high contrast mode enabled

3. **User Testing**
   - If possible, conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technologies

## Compliance Targets

The site should aim to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, which includes:

- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): At least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- 2.4.7 Focus Visible: All keyboard operable user interface has a visible focus indicator
- 1.1.1 Non-text Content: All images have alt text or are marked as decorative
- 2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality is operable through a keyboard
- 2.4.3 Focus Order: Navigation order is logical and intuitive

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommendations in this document
2. Conduct thorough testing with assistive technologies
3. Fix any issues found during testing
4. Document accessibility features for future maintenance
